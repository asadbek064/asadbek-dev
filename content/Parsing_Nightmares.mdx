---

Lately, I've been diving deep into the world of parser and [tokenizers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexical_analysis), attempting to rebuild [Stata](https://www.stata.com/) from scratch in JavaScript using [Chevrotain](https://chevrotain.io/docs/). It's been an exciting yet incredibly frustrating journey, and I've hit a roadblock that has me questioning my life choices.

## The Problem: Context-Sensitive Keywords

In [Stata](https://www.stata.com/), it's perfectly acceptable for command names to double as variable names. Consider this simple example:

```stata
generate generate = 2
```
```js
// example in js 
var var = 2; // not valid
```

In my initial implementation, I ran into two major issues:
    1. My token definitions were matching command keywords like **generate** indiscriminately, regardless of context.
    2. The command tokens were checked before identifier tokens in my lexer's order of precedence.

## I'm not Alone

After some digging through parsing forums and documentation, I discovered that this isn't an isolated problem. Many language implementers have wrestled with context-sensitive keywords. The common solutions often involve elaborate workarounds ranging from context-tracking mechanisms to entirely separate parsing passes.

## Some Suggested Solutions

### Token Precedence

Unfortunately, with my current Chevrotain setup, reordering token precedence isn't feasible because Chevrotain is a parser generator library for JS that uses LL(k) parsing techniques. 

### LL(k) parsing techniques

- **top-down parser** - starts with start symbol on stack, and repeatedly replace nonterminals until string is generated.
- **predictive parser** - predict next rewrite rule
- **first L of LL means** - read input string left to right
- **second L of LL means** - produces leftmost derivation
- **k** - number of lookahead symbols

It provides tools for building recursive-descent parser with full control over grammar definitions. This doesn't mean it can't handle token precedenceâ€”it definitely canâ€”but it requires manual implementation, which involves considerable effort.

### Contextual Parsing

Chevrotain has built in support for contextual tokens. We could define our keywords as contextual and enable them only in certain parsing rules.

### Post-Lexer Transformation

This is one is an interesting oneâ€”post-lexing examines the token stream and reclassifies command tokens to identifiers based on their syntactic position.

Each of these methods has its merits and its tradeoffs. If anyone has tackled this issue from a different angle or has additional suggestions, I'd love to hear your thoughts.
