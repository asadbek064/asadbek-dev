## Intro
In the ever-evolving landscape of online media streaming, the way we access and enjoy
digital content has undergone a remarkable transformation. Gone are the days when websites
conveniently served up simple <b>MP4</b> files for your viewing pleasure. Instead, the digital
realm now employes a more intricate web of technologies to deliver video contet, ensuring
seamless playback and adaptive quality adjusments to cater to your device's capabilites and network conditions.

In this blog, I will share my experience of all the intricacies of video streaming in the modern  age.
We'll delve into the world of M3U8 manifests, define concepts of HLS (HTTP Live streaming) and DASH(Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over
HTTP). But That's just the beginning. The heart of the blog will focuse on how to uncover the techniques websites
employ to safeguard their streaming content. They use a myriad of startegies, such as

* Generating one-time dynamic video links tethering users to their IP addresses
* Imposing rate limits
* Obfuscating the source links through hashing

These measures aim to deter any unauthorized access to their media.

However, fear not, as I will also share knowledge and tools to navigate through these digital mazes.
You learn to recognzie patterns and write scripts that unlock the secrets of video stream links. I will
also show how to download these video using FFmpeg, a powerfull multimead framework that will enable you
to download segments of videos and reconstruct it.


## Chrome Developer Tools
To move forward I assume you have some basic knowledge of Chrome dev tools.
Here's how to get start.

1. Open Chrome Developer Tools
press <b>Ctrl+Shift+I</b> or on Mac <b>Cmd+Option+I</b>

2. Familiarize with the Network Tab
In the Developer Tools panel, navigate to the "Network" tab. This tab provides a comprehensive view of network activity.
By monitoring the Network tab, you can track network requests, discover hidden resources, and 
analyze how videos are delivered.

3. Let's grab some mp4 using the network tab.
    1. Here open this [link](https://reactallplayer.asadk.dev/) while having your dev tools open and network tab selected.
    While on the page it good rule of thumb to press <b>CTRL+R</b>.

    Now click the play button

    Most website vidoes do not autoplay and usually the video source does not get sent until the user request to play it. Website 
    implement many mitgation startegies to hide there video links we will discusse this later on.
    For the above link there are no protection implemented.

    2. Filter by Media
    To narrow down the list and focus on video-related requests, select "Media" from filter categories.

    3.Find the Video Link
    Look for a request that represent the video content. This request will likely have
    <b>.mp4</b> or <b>m3u8</b>. Click it to reveal more details.

    Congratulations! You've just discoverd the video link using Chrome Developer Tools.
    This is the true source for the video, we'll dive deeper into advanced techniques for accessing and extracting video content.



## What the heck is M3U8
An M3U8 file is like a set of instructions for your device to play an online video. It tells your device where to find different parts of the video and how to play them in the right order.

**#EXTM3U** Indicates that this is an M3U8 manifest file.  <br/>
**#EXT_X-VERSION:4** Specifies theversion on HLS protocol <br/>
**#EXT-X-MEDIA:TYPE=AUDIO ... URI="audio.m3u8"** Describes the audio track for the video stream with default states.<br/>
**BANDWIDTH** Bitrate of th estream in `bits per secon` (2000000 for 2Mbps).<br/>
**RESOLUTION** Video resolution (e.g 1280x720 for 720 for 720p)<br/>
**[CODECS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_codecs)** Specifies the video and adio codecs used (e.g [H.264](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Video_Coding) and [AAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Audio_Coding))<br/>
**stream_720p.m3u8, stream_540p.m3u8, and stream_360p.m3u8**: These are the URIs to the actual video playlists for each variant.


## What is adaptive bitrate streaming?
Adaptive bitrate streaming optimizes video quality by dynamically adjusting to network conditions, enhancing the streaming experience over HTTP networks. This ensures seamless playback for viewers, irrespective of their device, location, or internet speed.

## What are the benefits of adaptive bitrate streaming?
As of 2022, TikTok users collectively stream one billion hours of video content daily. Video communication, advertising, and education are thriving on this platform, emphasizing the importance of quality playback. Adaptive bitrate streaming on TikTok brings significant benefits:

 - **Expanded Reach:** Without adaptive bitrate streaming, users with slower connections or specific devices might miss out on engaging TikTok videos.
 - **Enhanced User Experience:** Adaptive bitrate streaming minimizes buffering, reducing frustrating loading delays and enhancing the overall enjoyment for TikTok users.
 - **Seamless Mobile Viewing:** Mobile streaming on TikTok has skyrocketed. Adaptive bitrate streaming adjusts to variable mobile network conditions, ensuring uninterrupted viewing experiences as users move from one location to another.

 ## There are **two** streaming protocols that support adaptive bitrate streaming.
 A [protocol](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-a-protocol/) is a set of standars that dictate how data is packaged and processed across networks. Streaming has its own set of protocls.

 **HLS** and **DASH** are two streaming protocols with distinct characteristics:
  - **HLS:** HLS accommodates both on-demand and live streaming, utilizing the H.264 or H.265 encoding format. Unlike some protocols, it doesn't necessitate special servers. Initially designed for Apple devices, HLS is now compatible with various platforms. However, Apple devices exclusively support the HLS format.
  - **DASH:** DASH doesn't mandate a specific encoding standard. Any origin server can be configured for DASH streams as it operates over HTTP. Unlike HLS and most other formats, DASH is incompatible with Apple devices. 

In the previous example of extracting video links, the video was in the form of an mp4, and all you needed was one link. However, as no one serves mp4 over the internet anymore due to the widespread use of adaptive bitrate technology, the question arises: How can we extract and download adaptive bitrate videos?

## How can we extract and download adaptive bitrate videos?'
### Step 1: Find m3u8 / MPEG-DASH file.
  
  example: <br />
  `M3U8_URL = http://example.com/path/to/your/file.m3u8`
    
  `MPEG-DASH_URL = http://example.com/path/to/your/file.mpd`

### Step 2: Use FFMPEG download all segments.
  1. [Download ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) 
    - For linux  <kbd> sudo apt install ffmpeg</kbd>

  2. This will download all the segments mentioned in the m3u8 file to the current directory.

  - **HLS**
    <kbd>ffmpeg -protocol_whitelist file,http,https,tcp,tls,crypto -i "$M3U8_URL" -c copy -bsf:a aac_adtstoasc output.mp4</kbd>

  - **MPEG-DASH**
    <kbd>ffmpeg -i "$MPD_URL" -c copy -bsf:a aac_adtstoasc output.mp4</kbd>
   

### Step 3: Construct the segments to one vidoe.  
  
  If the segments have been downloaded to the current directory, you can use the following command to concatenate them.

  - **HLS** <kbd>``` ffmpeg -f concat -safe 0 -i <(for f in ./*.ts; do echo "file '$PWD/$f'"; done) -c copy output.mp4 ```</kbd>

  - **MPEG-DASH**
  <kbd>``` ffmpeg -f concat -safe 0 -i <(for f in ./*.mp4; do echo "file '$PWD/$f'"; done) -c copy output.mp4 ```</kbd>
