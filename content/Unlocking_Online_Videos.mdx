## Intro
In the ever-evolving landscape of online media streaming, the way we access and enjoy
digital content has undergone a remarkable transformation. Gone are the days when websites
conveniently served up simple <b>MP4</b> files for your viewing pleasure. Instead, the digital
realm now employes a more intricate web of technologies to deliver video contet, ensuring
seamless playback and adaptive quality adjusments to cater to your device's capabilites and network conditions.

In this blog, I will share my experience of all the intricacies of video streaming in the modern  age.
We'll delve into the world of M3U8 manifests, define concepts of HLS (HTTP Live streaming) and DASH(Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over
HTTP). But That's just the beginning. The heart of the blog will focuse on how to uncover the techniques websites
employ to safeguard their streaming content. They use a myriad of startegies, such as

* Generating one-time dynamic video links tethering users to their IP addresses
* Imposing rate limits
* Obfuscating the source links through hashing

These measures aim to deter any unauthorized access to their media.

However, fear not, as I will also share knowledge and tools to navigate through these digital mazes.
You learn to recognzie patterns and write scripts that unlock the secrets of video stream links. I will
also show how to download these video using FFmpeg, a powerfull multimead framework that will enable you
to download segments of videos and reconstruct it.


## Chrome Developer Tools
To move forward I assume you have some basic knowledge of Chrome dev tools.
Here's how to get start.

1. Open Chrome Developer Tools
press <b>Ctrl+Shift+I</b> or on Mac <b>Cmd+Option+I</b>

2. Familiarize with the Network Tab
In the Developer Tools panel, navigate to the "Network" tab. This tab provides a comprehensive view of network activity.
By monitoring the Network tab, you can track network requests, discover hidden resources, and 
analyze how videos are delivered.

3. Let's grab some mp4 using the network tab.
    1. Here open this [link](https://reactallplayer.asadbek.dev/) while having your dev tools open and network tab selected.
    While on the page it good rule of thumb to press <b>CTRL+R</b>.

    Now click the play button

    Most website vidoes do not autoplay and usually the video source does not get sent until the user request to play it. Website 
    implement many mitgation startegies to hide there video links we will discusse this later on.
    For the above link there are no protection implemented.

    2. Filter by Media
    To narrow down the list and focus on video-related requests, select "Media" from filter categories.

    3.Find the Video Link
    Look for a request that represent the video content. This request will likely have
    <b>.mp4</b> or <b>m3u8</b>. Click it to reveal more details.

    Congratulations! You've just discoverd the video link using Chrome Developer Tools.
    This is the true source for the video, we'll dive deeper into advanced techniques for accessing and extracting video content.



## What the heck is M3U8
An M3U8 file is like a set of instructions for your device to play an online video. It tells your device where to find different parts of the video and how to play them in the right order.
